## Abstract

Motivated by their robustness to partially unknown functional forms, supervised machine learning estimators are increasingly leveraged for causal inference. One method that has received much attention is double/debiased machine learning (DML), which allows leveraging generic supervised machine learners for the estimation of common (causal) parameters. In this paper, we review DML and provide practical guidance to empirical researchers. We highlight three points: First, DML allows researchers to focus their attention on defining credible identifying assumptions while weakening assumptions of convenience such as linearity. Second, DML is versatile in that it can accommodate high-dimensional sets of variables (e.g. arising from text data) but also provides a cheap and sensible robustness check when only a few controls or instruments are observed. Third, the use of poorly validated machine learners may yield misleading inferences. Considering a diverse set of nuisance function estimators (including parametric estimators) alleviates this problem. We use several applications to illustrate these main points and derive practically relevant recommendations for empirical researchers.
